# CLRS
I will be working through the CLRS textbook, Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein to get a better understanding of algorithms and data structures. I will only be uploading the programming questions/examples to the repository.
